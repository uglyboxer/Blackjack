""" blackjack.py
Author: Cole Howard

A simple implementation of the game of blackjack.

The user is tasked with defining the number of decks of 52 cards to be used in
the shoe.  The game can then be played until the shoe runs out or the user opts
out.

Usage
-----

Copy the folder Blackjack (capital B) and run the script:

>>>python3 blackjack/bj_main.py

All interaction will be via stdout on the command line.

Tests can be run from the same directory via

>>>nosetests

or

>>>py.test

------------
    Python 3.0 or newer
    random.shuffle
    Card class from card.py
